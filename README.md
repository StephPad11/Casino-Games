 Practicing Clases with Casino games

I want to practice coding, specifically classes so I'm creating a git repository of different casino games with the goal of adding a new one every few days and in the end making the games playable not just by text but with visuals as well.

If all goes well, I hope to make fantasy casino games that I can use while Dungeon Mastering if my party ends up in a magical city, in the middle of the desert, where the buildings are built with bright lights and excitement, where one can lose track of self and time in an effort to enrich those that run the cit...Vegas, vegas is literally a fantasy city of sin run by wizards...
